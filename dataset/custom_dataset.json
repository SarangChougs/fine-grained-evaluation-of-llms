As a rogue bounty hunter, there was nothing Drake feared, and the scar covering his left eye proved this even further. \n\nHe had otherworldly energy about him, his electric undercut framing his face. His lone eye was like a star, burning wildly in his journey to find out the truth regarding his family. As he walked through the streets, heads turned in awe—this hero was synonymous with hope for the people and the city, as 3098 was the universe’s most dangerous year.\n\nIn Drake’s holster was a next-generation laser pistol capable of exterminating dangerous cyborgs in just one good shot. It was clear Drake was fighting on the side of humanity, clinging to hope that his own agenda would someday be fulfilled.",

The three main macronutrients, namely carbs, protein, and fat, play specific roles in providing energy and supporting muscle function during workouts. Carbohydrates are important for short and high-intensity exercises, as they fuel your muscles by replenishing glycogen stores. Protein consumption before exercise can enhance muscle protein synthesis, leading to benefits such as increased muscle mass, improved recovery, and enhanced performance. While fat serves as a source of fuel for longer and moderate-to-low intensity exercises, the effects of fat intake specifically before exercise require further research. Overall, understanding the role of each macronutrient and their appropriate consumption can help optimize your pre-workout nutrition.",

Cogging torque occurs due to the reaction force generated when the teeth of the gear drive mesh. This force pushes against each other, resulting in a drag force that is transmitted from the gears to the shaft. The magnitude of the cogging torque can vary depending on the size and number of teeth, as well as the gear's material and design. Cogging torque is undesirable in most motorized applications, as it can lead to loss of efficiency. To reduce cogging torque, gear designs are often symmetrical or have certain tooth profiles which reduce the force of contact between the teeth when they come into contact with each other.",
