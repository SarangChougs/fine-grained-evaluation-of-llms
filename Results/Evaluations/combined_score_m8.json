Carbohydrates: These are the main source of energy for your body and should be eaten about 2 hours before your workout. They will help you power through your workout and prevent muscle breakdown.\n2. Protein: This is essential for building and repairing muscles after exercise. Try to eat about 30 grams of protein about an hour before your workout to ensure it's digested and absorbed by your body.\n3. Healthy fats: These include polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats such as avocado, nuts, and olive oil. Fats provide essential fatty acids that your body needs but can't make on its own. Consuming healthy fats will also keep you feeling fuller longer.\n4. Water: Stay hydrated! Drink plenty of water before and during your workout. Dehydration can impair performance, cause muscle cramps, and even lead to heat illness. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses (8 oz each) of water before your workout.\n5. Complex carbohydrates: These include whole grains, quinoa, and sweet potatoes. Complex carbohydrates release energy slowly into your bloodstream, which is ideal before a workout as it will give you sustained energy without spiking insulin levels.\n6. Vitamins and minerals: A balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals can also help with recovery and performance. Include foods high in vitamin C, such as citrus fruit, bell peppers, and broccoli; and try to get enough calcium, magnesium, zinc, and iron from dairy products, legumes, nuts, and whole grains.\nBy including these key nutrients in your pre-workout meal, you will be better prepared to perform your best during your workout and recover faster afterwards.",

These boulders, made of hard granite, led to the city being known as the \"Granite City\".\n\nIt is believed that the name \"Aberdeen\" comes from the Gaelic word for \"the mouth of the Don\", which refers to the river Don that runs through the city.

This philosophy uses energy forces to create harmony between an individual and their environment. In interior design, Feng Shui is applied through the placement of furniture and objects to allow a smooth flow of energy, or \"qi,\" within a space. This could involve orienting a bed or desk in a certain way, using specific colors, clearing clutter, or balancing various elements (wood, fire, earth, metal, water) to create a peaceful, balanced environment conducive to health and prosperity."

            "generated_output": "Feng Shui is an ancient Chinese system of harmonizing people with their environment. It is based on the belief that everything in the world has a balance or energy called \"qi\" (pronounced \"chee\"). Good qi comes from nature and can be enhanced by using certain objects or arrangements of objects in your home or office. On the other hand, bad qi can come from things such as sharp corners, strong colors, and unnatural shapes.\n\nFeng Shui practitioners use a variety of techniques to help bring good qi into a space. These include:\n\n* Placement of furniture: Furniture should be placed so that it faces the door and does not block the flow of qi. Also, the placement of each piece of furniture should be carefully considered. For example, beds should not be positioned under a beam or directly across from the door.\n* Colors and lighting: Different colors have different effects on qi. Lighting also plays a role in setting the mood and directing the flow of qi.\n* Decorative items: Feng Shui recommends using plants, artwork, and other decorative items to add positive energy to a space.\n* Water features: Water features such as fountains or ponds are believed to attract positive energy and are often used to create a sense of balance in a space.\n\nIn short, Feng Shui is a holistic system of design that seeks to create harmony between people and their environment. The goal is to create a space that feels comfortable, energized, and conducive to success.",

Cogging torque occurs due to the reaction force generated when the teeth of the gear drive mesh. This force pushes against each other, resulting in a drag force that is transmitted from the gears to the shaft. The magnitude of the cogging torque can vary depending on the size and number of teeth, as well as the gear's material and design. Cogging torque is undesirable in most motorized applications, as it can lead to loss of efficiency. To reduce cogging torque, gear designs are often symmetrical or have certain tooth profiles which reduce the force of contact between the teeth when they come into contact with each other."

It is also known as reluctance torque or back-EMF torque.\nCogging torque is caused by the fact that the magnetic field of the permanent magnet does not align perfectly with the magnetic field of the electromagnet. This results in a \"cog\"-like effect where the rotor moves in one direction but experiences a force in the opposite direction.\nCogging torque can be either positive or negative depending on the orientation of the permanent magnet and electromagnet. Positive cogging torque occurs when the permanent magnet and electromagnet are aligned, while negative cogging torque occurs when they are misaligned.\nIn an electric motor, cogging torque can cause vibrations and noises, and it can also reduce the efficiency of the motor. On the other hand, in an electric generator, cogging torque can be used to produce usable energy from the AC power supply.\nIn general, cogging torque is undesirable because it reduces the performance of the motor or generator, but it can also be used to advantage in some applications.",
